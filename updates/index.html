i.e.:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/releases/download/pydev_12_0_0/content.jar">https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/releases/download/pydev_12_0_0/content.jar</a><br>
<a href="https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/releases/download/pydev_12_0_0/artifacts.jar">https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/releases/download/pydev_12_0_0/artifacts.jar</a><br>
